# ChatBot
A Simple ChatBot Widget

Kindly create an api.ai account for chalk-n-paper and train the bot and integrate it in their website by using api.ai client key.

Also based on getting the required fields (like name, email) , you can call your json backend to send email/integrate in slack etc.
Parameter to check if all fields are entered is actionIncomplete.
(I have written comments in the JS file)
You can use webhooks directtly to api.ai or call json api from js file based on actionIncomplete parameter = false.

Also this ChatBot is built in the form of widget, every logic happens in js file including dynamic html content addition.
